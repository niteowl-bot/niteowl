# NiteOwl AI - Project Context

## Project

NiteOwl AI is a SaaS platform for small and medium businesses.

The first product is **Remy**, an AI Receptionist that answers customer enquiries, books appointments, captures leads and escalates unusual requests to the business.

This repository is the source of truth.

GitHub should always reflect the latest working state.

If not, recommend postponing it.

# Brand

Company:
NiteOwl AI

First Product:
Remy

Positioning:

Remy is an AI Receptionist that never misses a customer enquiry.

It answers questions, books appointments, captures leads and gracefully hands unusual requests to a human.

# Architecture Rule

Every new feature must:

- reuse existing helpers
- never create duplicate systems
- remain backward compatible
- be implemented one step at a time
- be tested after every step

Architecture discussion always comes before code.

---

# Development Principles

These rules must always be followed.

## Never refactor working code.

If a feature works and has been tested:

- leave it alone
- make additive changes only
- reuse existing helpers
- avoid duplicate systems
- preserve backwards compatibility

Every new feature should be implemented in small isolated steps.

After each step I will test before continuing.

---

# Core Architecture

Remy consists of:

- Dashboard
- Website Widget
- Dashboard Preview Chat
- AI Chat API
- Knowledge Base
- Business Hours
- Booking Engine
- Capacity Checking
- Calendar
- Lead CRM
- Settings
- Onboarding Wizard

Both Dashboard Preview and Website Widget must always use the same booking engine and AI behaviour.

Only their lead source differs.

---

# Lead Sources

Current lead sources include:

- chat
- web_widget
- dashboard_preview

These must remain separated.

Dashboard testing must never pollute production analytics.

---

# Booking Principles

Booking logic must never be broken.

Current functionality includes:

- availability checking
- business hours
- capacity limits
- double booking prevention
- appointment parsing
- automatic lead merging
- booking confirmation flow

---

# Knowledge Base

Knowledge records are fully editable.

Categories include:

- FAQ
- Services
- Pricing
- Opening Hours
- Policies
- Custom Instructions

The Knowledge Base drives Remy's responses.

---

# Needs Review Workflow

Purpose:

When Remy cannot confidently answer:

- never invent an answer
- never break booking flow

Instead:

- collect missing contact details
- create/update lead
- status = needs_review
- notify business owner
- customer receives a polite handoff response

Notification should only be sent once.

Use metadata JSONB to store:

needs_review_notification_sent = true

---

# Current Tech Stack

# Coding Style

Always:

- additive changes

- minimal edits
- explain architecture before coding

Never:

- rewrite whole files
- refactor unrelated code
- change working booking logic
- duplicate systems

---
